Hello!
My name is Furqan, and I’m currently studying for an HND in Computing (Software Engineering).
This project is part of a class assignment where I was given a scenario to analyze, identify user requirements, and develop a clothing store website based on that analysis.

Getting Started

Step 1: Install XAMPP
Download and install XAMPP from https://www.apachefriends.org if you haven’t already.

Step 2: Download the Project Folder
Download or clone this repository. The folder is named E-Commerce.

Step 3: Move to htdocs
Copy the E-Commerce folder into your XAMPP htdocs directory:

Step 4: Start XAMPP
Open the XAMPP Control Panel and start Apache and MySQL.

Step 5: Run the Website
Open your web browser and type the following into the address bar:

Final Notes
That’s it! The project should now be up and running locally.
